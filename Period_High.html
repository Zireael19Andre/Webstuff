      <p style="font-weight: bold">
        Back in High School, nearly every Chinese student worked so hard trying to get a better score in the National College Entrance Examination. But I wasn't one of them until the beginning of senior. Back that time, everyday was like a deja-vu to me. Being told I might not able to go to university with that score. I was quite lost and eagerly trying to find a motivation.

        Somehow the idol group AKB48 become the first bond between me and Japanese culture. Watching my peers bursting their energy and chasing the dream, I was deeply touched and shamed. I start to focus on the basics, stay humble, trying to fight for my way to the college. This motivation seems pretty silly right now, but it do saved me from falling off a cliff.
